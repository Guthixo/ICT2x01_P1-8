# Workflow
### Commandments
1. The `master` branch will be the team's **baseline** branch
2. Development **features** should be branched off the respective development branches.
3. Changes shall only be made to the respective `car` and `web` branches.
4. Once 3. is done, code will have to be evaluated, before finalizing into the `master` branch.

### Branches

1. Branch Naming Conventions
The branch should be correctly named, in accordance to the feature / fix.

2. Branching Conventions
New features / fixes should be **branched off** the respective development branches:
`car`
`web`

3. Merging Conventions
*Code committed -> Code reviewed -> Code merged into `master` branch -> Baseline* 
Committed code should be properly reviewed by another party of the team. 
Request for a pull, before merging from the new branch to the respective development branches.
